bad lemmas: "at" / "t" etc.

## why I can't find my lemma?
There are basically three possible reasons why you can see a lemma you were searching:
1. spelling variant. This tools can handle spelling variation, and suggest to the user, another the lemma. But it can do that long as there is one diffenrt between your word and the lemma. so it can sugget _appropinquo_ for input of _adporpinquo_. If, however, the user enters _clypeum_ this Tool can't find _clipeus_ since it is removed by 2 letters. 
2 . It seems sometimes the lemmetizer has some mechanism that yields lemmas which are less trivial. example to such is _spons_. it lemmatizes to _sponte_. Unfortunatelly
3. very low frequency
